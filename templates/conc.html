<p style="font-weight:bold">Based on the analysis carried out above, I have enough conclusions to present key differences between two types of users:

Casual users rent bikes for almost exactly double the duration of members' rentals (27.2 minutes on average vs 13.6 minutes).
Members use the bikes consistently during the whole week, with a small peak midweek. Casual users note highest usage during weekend, paired with a rise is duration of the rides.
Casual users' peak activity falls during late afternoon on workweek days (4â€“6 p.m), on weekends the peak activity falls between noon and early afternoon.
Casual users tend to rent the bikes near parks and green spaces, while members prefer locations in proximity of main communication routes.
Casual users' activity falls significantly during winter months.</p>
